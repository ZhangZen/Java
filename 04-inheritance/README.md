# Inheritance

## Context
In library management, we have class `Book` (in package `com.github.truongbb.demo`) with some properties `id`, `name`, `author`. 
Class `MathBook` is a book having same properties with `Book` and specially having one more property `type`. 
At that time, we must copy all properties, getter, setter, .. of `Book` into `MathBook`, that makes code duplication.
In the future, if we create more methods and properties in `Book`, we must copy into `MathBook` ==> So terrible.

We'll use inheritance.

## 1. Inheritance


## 2. Override



## 3. Basic polymorphism
